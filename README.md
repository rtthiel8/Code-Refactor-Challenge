# Code-Refactor-Challenge

## In this project, I took code that wasn't entirely functional, lacking semantic elements, needlessy complicated in its CSS declarations and did not meet accessibility standards and refactored it to correct these issues.

- I needed to practice identifying issues with sample code and making necessary changes in order to ensure that it works while being as simple and clean as possible. As well as following best practices and making it accessibile to as many people as I can.
- My (theoretical) employer needed the issues with their site fixed and utilized me to correct them.
- The site now has information embedded that a screen reader can use to convey more information to people that need them (i.e. Title, alt tags for photos). The links now all function as they should and the CSS is less redundant and lengthy. I added semantic elements to make the structure more apparent and not just div soup.
- I learned how to identify issues within code and amend it, the importance of accessibility standards and how to meet them, and how to consolidate CSS while maintaining its style. Also how vital semantic elements are to making the code understandable and structured.
